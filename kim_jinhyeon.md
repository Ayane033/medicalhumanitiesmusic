# La Peste
In the 1940s, when World War II was in full swing, a sudden plague broke out in Oran, a small city on the northern coast of French Algeria, and the city of Orang was cut off from the outside and citizens were isolated accordingly. It philosophically dealt with the existence of human beings, which is revealed as the curtain continues for a year, with dozens or hundreds of people dying a day while isolated from the outside.

[It shows what choices](https://youtu.be/1Rw7p8McXzw?feature=shared), humans make in the face of the inevitable catastrophic fate that is facing everyone, centering on the protagonist, Dr. Li and Health University. Not only is it a representative work of existentialist literature, but it is also the beginning of the disaster novel genre in public.


Example : The smiliar disease is described in Suran's 2024 sing.[*Erotic Joke*](yum_jihyeon.md) , Aids.


The film adaptation’s theme song, “Psalmus Ode,” intensifies this sense of spiritual and emotional turmoil. Through its haunting choral progression and somber orchestration, the piece reflects the sacred silence of collective grief and the spiritual vacuum left by the plague. It is used in key scenes not merely to underscore sadness but to elevate the silent, resilient dignity of people confronting suffering without answers.

The music avoids melodrama, instead echoing the existential tone of the novel—it does not portray illness as punishment or tragedy, but as a condition that reveals our shared vulnerability. Through the combination of image, story, and sound, The Plague delivers a powerful reflection on disease and disability—not as individual misfortune, but as a universal, inescapable part of being human.

Example : The similar desease is described in Park Sang Young's 2024 drama [*The Love Law of Big city*](yum_jihyeon.md) The drama suran song "Erotic Joke"
