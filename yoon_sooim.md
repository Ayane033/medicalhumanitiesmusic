# It’s Okay, That’s Love(괜찮아, 사랑이야)

It is drama, created by Noh Hee-kyung.

This drama helped bring greater awareness to schizophrenia. It gently portrays the journey of a protagonist who learns to accept their diagnosis, undergoes treatment, and gradually overcomes personal challenges, ultimately finding love and healing along the way.

'It’s Okay, That’s Love' is a song that reveals the hearts of those parties well. It shows that even the most ordinary people do not know and live with emotional illness. This song flows out of the scene where the main characters silently confess their true feelings, and it can be seen that it is a song that reveals the meaning that love is not about changing the other person, but about staying with that person's pain.

Example: There are similarities with my data in that it is a ballad OST for Korean drama called [*Doctor Slump*](bae_sangjun.md). Both works portray psychological suffering not merely as a pathological condition, but as something that can be healed through emotional connections, empathy, and love between people.
