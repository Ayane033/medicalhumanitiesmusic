# Cheongseol(Hear Me)

 The film Cheongseol portrays hearing impairment not as a deficiency, but as an expansion of perception—a concept often referred to as Deaf Gain, [with the song "Four Season"](https://youtu.be/PO6VyzBZWcI?si=W61sXzlxYA1ndZGV). Rather than focusing on what is lost, the film highlights how silence can awaken a deeper emotional sensitivity and richer forms of interpersonal connection. The main theme song, Season (Gyejeol), sung by No Yoon-seo and her younger sister—both portrayed as hearing-impaired—serves as a key emotional bridge. Its soft piano melody and gradually
 layered strings trace an emotional arc that mirrors the evolving relationship between the sisters: their shared loneliness, a yearning for conection, a quiet affection, and an unspoken but powerful understanding. One espeacially moving scene unfolds in a sunlit room where the sisters, seated across from each other, communicate solely through facial expressions, touch, and rhythm. There are no words, only Season playing gently in the background. In that stillness, a subtle shift occurs: a timid glance becomes a smile, a hand resting on another's signals trust. Through these gestures, the music becomes their shared voice-translating silence into intimacy. The piece doesn't merely accompany the film: it speaks for it, turning absence of sound into a powerful form of expression. In doing so, Season affirms that emotional truth does not depend on hearing, and that silence is not emptiness but a space where other forms of meaning can emerge. Cheongseol invites the audience into a world where human connection blooms not in speech, but in stillness, light, and resoncance. 

Example: The same disease is described in Sian Heder's 2021 film [*CODA*](han_gahyeon.md). The film contains Joni mitchell's song "Both sides now".

If I were to choose one song to be played at my funeral, it would be ["You Are My Star" by Lee Woo](https://youtu.be/XmMM8XVsZXw?si=76X6LswEBEKw8EKd). The lyrics-"You are my star, my happiness, my gift"-carry a quiet yet powerful sentiment. They speak not only of affection, but of gratitude and presence. I chose this song because I hope, in some way, my life was just that to someone - a small light, a source of warmth, a meaningful gift.
Rather than a farewell heavy with sorrow, I would want this moment to feel like a hentle thank-you - a final reminder that love, however fleeting, leaves behind something lasting. This song captures that feeling with simplicity and grace.

38세 여성 A는 두 아이를 키우며 가정을 돌보는 데 전념해 왔다. 큰아이는 초등학생, 작은아이는 아직 유치원에 다니고 있는 나이이다. 남편은 직장 생활을 하고 있어 평일 동안의 대부분의 육아와 집안일은 A가 맡고 있었다. 일상은 반복적이었지만, 아이들과 함께 보내는 시간에 만족하며 지내고 있었다. 정기적으로 받던 건강검진을 받게 된 그녀는 암 진단을 받게 되었고, 치료를 위해 항암 요법과 수술을 병행해야 한다는 설명을 들었다. 갑작스러운 진단은 단순히 건강 문제를 넘어서,아이들, 남편의 일상까지도 걱정을 하게되었다. 치료가 시작되면서 체력이 급격히 떨어디고, 일상적으로 하던 일들—아이들 등하원 챙기기, 식사 준비, 빨래—조차 감당하기 어려워졌지만, 이를 아이들이 눈치채고 스스로 성숙해지려고 하는 모습을 보는 것이 더욱 더 힘들었다. 이 시기를 지나며 엄마로서의 역할을 완전히 놓지 않기 위해 여러 방식으로 노력했다. 이때의 경험은 가족들에게 [완벽하고 이상적인 가족이 중요한 것이 아니라 함께라는 것이 중요하다](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2eE_wzCQFQkCuzmkJZWH-BoE6jbNkTkV&si=co8Q_1LvKwP_LEG0)는 것을 마음에 새기게 해주었다.
