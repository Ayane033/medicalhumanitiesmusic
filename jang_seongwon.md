# Nymphomaniac

In the film Nymphomaniac, the story is about a woman named Joe. After she is found hurt, she tells her life story to Seligman, the man who rescued her. Whenever Joe tells a story, Seligman keeps trying to annotate it with his knowledge of things like fishing, mathematics, psychology or music. Their talk becomes a kind of smart argument, like a game of ping-pong: Joe shares her feelings, and Seligman replies with his logical ideas.

The film's title, 'Nymphomaniac,' refers to Joe. This goes beyond merely having a strong libido; it signifies a state of persistent failure to control repetitive sexual impulses, where one's life becomes dominated by that behavior.

In [chapter 5 The Little Organ School](https://youtu.be/dIvuZ1bmrWs?feature=shared), Seligman starts the conversation with, “It's something I've been listening to a lot lately.” and introduces Bach’s chorale prelude <Ich ruf zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ>. “This piece has three voices: the bass voice, the second voice played with the left hand, and first voice played with the right hand. (…) And together, these three voices create the polyphony.”
Joe immediately maps her nymphomaniac experience onto this musical form. “Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as... someone who can't get enough, and therefore, has sex with many different people. Well, that, of course, is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. So in that way, I have only one lover.”

An intellectually elegant metaphor seems to be born. The film supports Joe's claim with a seductive formalism. She maps her partner F, the "monotonous foundation," to the bass line. G, the "unpredictable" partner, is assigned to the alto line. Jerome, who was "love," corresponds to the brilliant soprano. These three melodies are finally integrated into a perfect ensemble within a [split-screen montage(**Includes sexual content**)](https://vimeo.com/1036892452?share=copy). In this moment, her argument appears audiovisually complete.

Yet, this elegant metaphor falls apart when faced with the evidence she herself provides. True polyphony is a harmony of unique, irreplaceable voices. Joe’s partners, in contrast, are reduced to anonymous initials like 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'G', 'H' and 'K'. Beyond these figures, there are many more partners who pass in and out of her without even a name or any identifying mark. Their lack of identity—whether through initials or absence of them—exposes them as nothing more than entities fulfilling a role. They are treated as functional parts, replaceable rather than as unique individuals. This dehumanization proves the history of her body's failure to achieve satisfaction and intimacy. A true 'ensemble' cannot be built from non-unique parts. Faced with this contradiction, the beautiful narrative constructed by the mind can no longer be defended.

The fact that this inherently flawed metaphor is directed with such aesthetic perfection gives rise to irony, and the power of this scene comes from that ironic failure. The sublime music does not save the chaotic life. It functions as a cynical mirror that reflects its emptiness. Yet, what is revealed at the end of this deconstruction is not mere cynicism, but a truth of a deeper dimension. It is not the 'perfect harmony' Joe intended to show. Instead, it is the more honest truth that her self is constituted by 'the sum of all failed relationship온 모든 순간을 의심하며 내가 저지른 죄를 찾아 헤맸다. 피자를 좋아해서였을까? 운동이 부족해서였을까? 잠을 늦게 자서였을까? 손을 자주 씻지 않아서였을까? … 결정적인 원인 같은 건 없었다. 사소한 습관들과 무심코 넘겼던 선택들이 모여 지금의 병을 만든 모양이었다. 그야말로 모든 순간이 오류였다. 그러고 보면 나는 애초부터 이렇게 될 [운명](https://youtu.be/Td_Tn9VC_G8?feature=shared)이었는지도 모른다.

천식 발작은 밤에 더 심해지는 경향이 있다. 나는 가끔씩 익사 직전의 사람처럼 허우적거리며 고통스럽게 잠에서 깨어난다. 쌕쌕거리는 숨소리가 고요한 방 안을 가득 메운다. 어둠 속에서 침대 머리맡을 더듬어 흡입기를 찾았다. 다시 잠들기는 글렀다. 나는 이 고요하고 잔인한 시간 속에서 내가 잃어버린 것들을 생각했다. 평온한 [밤](https://youtu.be/8JrW-MOsbFw?feature=sharedhttps://youtu.be/8JrW-MOsbFw?feature=shared)은 이제 내게 허락되지 않는 꿈일 뿐이다.
