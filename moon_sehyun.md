# Keys to the Heart

In "Keys to the Heart," music is not used to highlight Jin-tae's disability as a limitation, but rather to express his rich inner world and emotions. Although Jin-tae struggles with everyday communication due to his autism -at this point, it emphasizes his symptoms, especially difficulties in social relationships-, he is able to convey his feelings clearly through piano performance. The film uses music as a language that transcends verbal communication, portraying Jin-tae not as someone defined by his disability but as an individual with his own profound means of expression. In summary, through music, the movie illustrates that difference does not imply deficiency, and true understanding can happen beyond words.

In the movie, Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata (3rd Movement) is used when Jin-tae first reveals his hidden talent by playing the piano. The piece’s calm and melancholic tone reflects Jin-tae’s isolated inner world and marks the moment when his brother Jo-ha begins to see him in a new light.


I felt a sense of similarity between the work I selected and the storyline of [My Annoying brother](kim_yesung.md) in that both portray “reconciliation between siblings through music.” Both films effectively convey the emotional changes between brothers through instrumental music, without relying on lyrics. However, the film "Keys to the Heart", which I introduced, places music at the center of its narrative, thereby emphasizing the theme of reconciliation through music more strongly. In contrast, "My Annoying Brother" uses music mainly as background accompaniment, making its narrative role less prominent in comparison.

# 나의 장례식에 나오길 바라는 음악
나의 장례식에서는 칸예 웨스트의 [Ghost town](https://youtu.be/qAsHVwl-MU4?feature=shared) 이 틀어지길 희망한다. 그는 21세기 대중음악에 큰 공을 세웠고, 평단과 대중의 찬사를 받았지만 불안정한 모습을 많이 보였다. 그렇기에 그의 양극성 장애를 "I hate being Bi-polar. It's awesome"이라는 문구로 앨범 자켓에 표현한 정규 8집 "ye" 의 수록곡인 "Ghost town"에서 "Someday the drama'll be gone. And they'll play this song on and on." 이라는 가사는 의미심장하다. 그의 음악을 좋아하지만, 가끔 이해하기 힘든 과격한 언행을 보일 때도 많다. 그럼에도 이 곡에서 그가 전달하려는 메세지에는 진심이 담겨있고, 그를 통해 많은 위로를 받았기에 내 장례식에 온 사람들 역시 이 곡을 통해 나를 다시 떠올리고 위로받을 수 있기를 바란다.
