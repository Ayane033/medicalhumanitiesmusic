# Wonder

The song 'Heroes' contains the following lyrics: 'Though nothing will drive them away / We can beat them, just for one day / We can be heroes, just for one day'. Because the main character August has facial deformity, he has to fight through all the bias and the prejudice the world burdens him. The lyrics send a message that no matter what, the world will throw problems at him, and we can't do much to drive all the prejudice the world throws at him away. However, although life is hard and things are tough, the song implies that he can beat all that burden, and that he can still be hero in his own perspective and life, regardless of how others see him.

[The song 'Heroes'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXgkuM2NhYI) has a tune that is emotional and majestic, which goes along with the movie's main character. Situations get emotional as people's views are harsh towards the protagonist, but the movie still shows that life can be, and is beautiful which goes along with the majestic vibe of the song.

내 장례식에서 틀어졌으면 하는 노래는 [I will protect you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb5N4Czq_q0&list=RDBb5N4Czq_q0&start_radio=1)라는 노래다. 페르소나 3 리로드라는 게임에서 마지막에 나오는 ost인데, 게임의 이야기도 죽음과 관련되어 있을뿐더러, 노래 자체의 분위기도 모든 것을 마무리하는 분위기라 내 장례식에서 틀어졌으면 했다.

Example: A similar situation as the movie *Wonder* is described in a TV drama [*Extraordinary Attorney Woo*](kim_dawon.md). Both shows features a protagonist who are different compared to the world. Whilst people view them differently, both characters don't let others' view judge who they are and continue to do what they think it's right. It's hard when the whole world is biased towards you and when they judge you inside, but these protagonists don't let those biased views stop them and I think it's a feature we all can learn.
